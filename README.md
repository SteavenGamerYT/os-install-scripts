# My OS's Install Script

Tons of pepole reported that it does install tons of things without user confiration


To this pepole i say, ITS MY OS SETUP, NO ONE SHOULD RUN IT, JUST COPY FROM THE SH OR CMD WHAT YOU NEED


## What Does my script really do?


On ubuntu and fedora, It removes everything that is preinstalled as debs and rpms and installs everything i use from flatpak + it makes your system secure by installing Kicksecure patchs and it installs my custom user settings from my SteavenSettings repo
