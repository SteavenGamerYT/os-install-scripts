# My OS's Install Script

Tons of pepole reported that it does install tons of things without user confiration


To this pepole i say, ITS MY OS SETUP, NO ONE SHOULD RUN IT, JUST COPY FROM THE SH OR CMD WHAT YOU NEED


## What Does my script really do?


On ubuntu and fedora, It removes everything that is preinstalled as debs and rpms and installs everything i use from flatpak + it makes your system secure by installing Kicksecure patchs


on Arch, you use archinstall like this `btrfs + systemd-boot + network manager + egypt cairo` only no audio service no de, then run my sh to get my system


on windows it deblotes it and tweaks it and installs my apps
